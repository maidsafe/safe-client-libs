This is the crate for interfacing with application frontends. It contains code for applications to manipulate SAFE data-types on behalf of the owner and code for building the URI for communicating with [safe_authenticator](../safe_authenticator).

## Build Instructions

`safe_app` can interface conditionally against either the routing crate or a mock (routing and vault) used for local testing.

Please see [the project README](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_client_libs#building-from-source) for full build instructions.
