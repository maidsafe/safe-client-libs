# Wrapper for running the build in the context of a container.
#
# The reason why this exists is really just to ensure that the container
# runs with a unique name. This is to support running more than one build
# on a single machine, which could happen when we're using Jenkins. The
# container needs to have a known name so we can extract the artifacts
# from it after the build has finished.
#
# It's in a script rather than the Makefile because there are several things
# here that are quite awkward to do in a Makefile, like declaring new
# variables at run time.
